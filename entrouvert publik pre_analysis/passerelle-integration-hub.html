    <h1>Passerelle (Integration Hub)</h1>

    <h2 id="summary--integration">Summary &amp; Integration</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> is Publik’s middleware hub, responsible for connecting the platform to external information systems and APIs[33]. It acts as a uniform web services layer: external business applications (e.g. a city’s <a class="term" href="glossary.html#erp">ERP</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#gis">GIS</a>, or national data service) are integrated by writing connectors to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>, and the other Publik modules then talk to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> rather than each system individually. In the ecosystem, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> is invoked by modules like <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> (during form display or workflow actions) or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> (for portal cells) whenever data from an outside system is needed. For instance, if a form needs to populate a dropdown with data from a national address <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> or if a workflow needs to send a request to an external <a class="term" href="glossary.html#crm">CRM</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> handles that request. It essentially serves as a webservice hub that speaks multiple protocols and formats so that Publik’s internal components can remain agnostic of external peculiarities[33]. Integration-wise, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> has many sub-modules (connectors) for specific third-party services – the Entr’ouvert team maintains connectors for various government APIs (like address lookup, company info) and for vendor software used by local governments[34]. These connectors plug into <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>, and <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> or other modules simply call <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>’s unified <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> to trigger them. By translating data formats and protocols, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> ensures that, for example, a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#soap">SOAP</a> <a class="term" href="glossary.html#xml">XML</a> service or a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> database can be accessed and return <a class="term" href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a> to Publik’s front-end.</p>

    <h2 id="philosophy--design--usage">Philosophy, Design &amp; Usage</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>’s philosophy is to provide interoperability through abstraction. Rather than hard-coding integrations in each module, a single integration layer simplifies maintenance and encourages reusability of connectors across different forms or portals. It is designed to handle as many data exchange patterns as possible: it natively understands <a class="term" href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#xml">XML</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#csv">CSV</a>, and even direct <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a>, and can handle <a class="term" href="glossary.html#rest">REST</a> or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#soap">SOAP</a> webservice protocols[35]. The design is likely based on <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> (for the web framework and admin interface), given Entr’ouvert’s general use of Python/<a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a>. Connectors in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> are probably implemented as <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> apps or classes that define how to interact with a specific service (with configuration for endpoints, authentication, etc.). The choice to include support for multiple formats/protocols reflects a pragmatic approach – local governments have diverse systems, so <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> must be a Swiss-army knife. In usage, administrators or developers configure connectors usually by installing the appropriate Python package and adding an instance via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>’s admin (for example, configuring the credentials for a particular <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a>). Then <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> form designers can use those connectors by referencing them in form fields or workflow actions, without worrying about the underlying details. The philosophy of openness is evident: <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> only works with open, documented, structured protocols, meaning proprietary or closed systems need to offer some standard interface for <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> to use[35]. This encourages the adoption of open standards in the e-government context. Additionally, usage of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> encourages decoupling – if a city changes a backend system, updating or replacing a connector in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> should suffice, rather than altering all forms/workflows that use that data.</p>

    <h2 id="key-features--functions">Key Features &amp; Functions</h2>
    <p>The core function of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> is to serve as a translator and orchestrator for data exchanges. It provides a uniform RESTful <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> to Publik’s other modules while internally handling whatever protocol the target system requires[36]. Key features include: a library of pre-built connectors for a wide range of systems (from national government APIs to specific vendor software)[34]; support for various data formats (<a class="term" href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#xml">XML</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#csv">CSV</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> queries) as input/output[36]; and probably a plugin mechanism to add new connectors easily. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> likely offers logging and monitoring of calls (so one can trace what calls were made for auditing). Another function is data transformation – many connectors will need to transform data fields between Publik’s format and the external system’s format (for instance, mapping field names or encoding values). <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> provides a framework to do these transformations systematically. It also can handle authentication to external services (storing <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> keys, tokens, certificates as needed for each connector). In terms of essential operations, from the perspective of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a>, using <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> looks like calling a webservice: e.g., <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> might execute an action “call webservice X with these parameters,” and <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>’s job is to route that to the right connector, handle the request (perhaps converting to a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#soap">SOAP</a> <a class="term" href="glossary.html#xml">XML</a> envelope or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> query), then parse the response and give it back in a normalized format. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> speaks common web protocols: for example, it can consume <a class="term" href="glossary.html#rest">REST</a> APIs and return <a class="term" href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a> (likely the native format it uses with Publik modules is <a class="term" href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a>), or it can act as a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#soap">SOAP</a> client as needed[36]. It is essentially a hub-and-spoke design: multiple external “spokes” connect to the central hub (<a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>), simplifying the design of the rest of Publik. Its initial essential function set included those fundamental connectors and the ability to define new ones; given the version number (8.x) and numerous sub-packages listed (e.g., passerelle-montpellier-sig, passerelle-grandlyon-elyx, etc. in the package repository[37][38]), a lot of real-world connector logic is encapsulated in these modules.</p>

    <h2 id="unknowns-or-gaps">Unknowns or Gaps</h2>
    <p>While we know <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>’s broad capabilities, the internal architecture is not fully detailed in public docs. It’s not explicitly stated, for example, how one writes a new connector – presumably by subclassing some base connector class in Python, but the specifics are not in the documentation we’ve seen. Also unknown is how <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> is deployed in a multi-tenant environment: does each tenant have its own instance of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> (with isolated connector configurations), or does one <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> serve multiple tenants with tenant-aware connectors? Given <a class="term" href="glossary.html#hobo">Hobo</a>’s multitenancy, it could be the latter, but documentation is lacking. Another gap is how synchronous vs asynchronous calls are handled. If a connector call is long-running (say a slow <a class="term" href="glossary.html#soap">SOAP</a> service), does <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> offer asynchronous execution or timeouts? The behavior in such scenarios isn’t described publicly. Additionally, error handling strategy (e.g., if an external service is down, how are errors propagated to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> workflows) is not explicitly documented – likely it surfaces an error status, but specifics would be known by examining code or manuals. The extent of data caching is also unclear (possibly none, leaving caching to each service or to calling modules, to ensure real-time data). Lastly, security considerations (like how credentials are stored, how access to connectors is controlled) are not discussed in the high-level sources, leaving a bit of guesswork for implementers until they see configuration examples.</p>

    <h2 id="suppositions">Suppositions</h2>
    <p>We can suppose that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>’s development will continue to expand its library of connectors as new needs arise (for example, if new national APIs are released, connectors will be added). There might also be an ongoing effort to standardize connectors – for instance, if many cities use similar systems, Entr’ouvert likely refactors code to reuse connector components. Another supposition is that performance optimizations could be a focus: as more processes rely on <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>, the team might implement caching for certain read-only data (like caching a list of streets for a short period to avoid frequent external calls) while ensuring data freshness where it counts. It’s also reasonable to guess that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> uses <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> Rest Framework or a similar concept under the hood to expose its own <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a>, and that future versions might formalize a connector <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sdk">SDK</a> for third-party developers to write their own plugins more easily. In absence of explicit documentation, one assumes each connector is packaged separately (as seen by many python3-passerelle-... packages[39]) and that they are maintained alongside core <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>. Given the emphasis on open standards, a safe supposition is that if an external system does not provide a proper <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a>, it won’t be directly supported until it does – thus pushing vendors to open up. For new developers, it’s reasonable to think that learning <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> involves studying existing connector code to mimic the patterns. Finally, as Publik installations grow, one might foresee <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> being scaled horizontally or separated out if needed (for example, heavy integrations could be offloaded to separate workers), though at present it’s likely integrated in the same web stack. Overall, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>’s trajectory will likely involve deeper integration capabilities (possibly supporting new protocols or data formats) and keeping up with the evolving landscape of e-government web services.</p>
