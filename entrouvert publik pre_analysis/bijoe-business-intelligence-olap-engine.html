    <h1>BiJoe (Business Intelligence / OLAP Engine)</h1>

    <h2 id="summary--integration">Summary &amp; Integration</h2>
    <p>BiJoe is Publik’s business intelligence module, essentially a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#biolap"><a class="term" href="glossary.html#bi">BI</a>/<a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a></a> engine that works with data collected by other Publik components[50]. The name “<a class="term" href="glossary.html#bijoe">BIJoe</a>” implies <a class="term" href="glossary.html#bi">BI</a> (Business Intelligence) with a bit of whimsy. It serves to simplify querying a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#postgresql">PostgreSQL</a> database organized in a star schema (a typical data warehouse schema) and to produce dashboards or reports for analytical purposes[50]. In the Publik ecosystem, BiJoe sits downstream of the operational databases: for example, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> holds transactional data (forms submitted, requests processed), and BiJoe can take that data (through an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#etl">ETL</a> or export process) into a separate schema optimized for analysis (facts and dimensions). The integration is such that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> (and possibly <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>, etc.) push or export data to BiJoe’s schema via the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a>-<a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> extension or similar tools. Then BiJoe provides a query interface or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> to retrieve aggregated metrics. BiJoe can integrate with the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> portal by powering analytics dashboards for administrators – perhaps graphs or stats on the agent back-office. It might also be used in the Publik Famille context to analyze usage statistics (like number of child registrations, payments processed, etc.). Importantly, BiJoe is a library as well, meaning developers can use it within <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> to run <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> queries without writing complex <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a>[50]. In summary, BiJoe acts as the analytics layer, ensuring decision-makers can get insights from the data in Publik without needing an external <a class="term" href="glossary.html#bi">BI</a> tool.</p>

    <h2 id="philosophy--design--usage">Philosophy, Design &amp; Usage</h2>
    <p>The philosophy of BiJoe is to leverage the power of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> (particularly <a class="term" href="glossary.html#postgresql">PostgreSQL</a>) for analytics, but hide the complexity from the user. By using a star schema (fact and dimension tables), it organizes data in a way optimal for <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> queries (like grouping, summing, etc.), and by providing a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> app interface, it allows generating these queries through simpler Python code or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#ui">UI</a> selections. The design suggests that BiJoe likely defines models corresponding to dimensions (e.g., date, form type, location) and fact tables (e.g., submissions fact with measures like count, processing time). The mention that it’s a library and a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> application[50] means it can be embedded in a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> project (like the Publik admin site) to run queries, and also possibly has its own <a class="term" href="glossary.html#ui">UI</a> (maybe a simple interface to execute predefined queries or to connect to external dashboard tools). BiJoe probably uses <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a>’s <a class="term" href="glossary.html#orm">ORM</a> minimally, because <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> queries often use raw <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> for performance; so the library part might construct <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> queries (for example, to pivot data). In usage, an administrator or developer defines what metrics they want – for instance, “number of requests per month per department” – and BiJoe helps by providing the means to query the star schema instead of the normalized transactional schema. BiJoe’s approach is likely data-agnostic regarding Publik modules: it doesn’t inherently know about forms or appointments, but through extensions like <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a>-<a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a>, it gets the data structure. The design choice to separate <a class="term" href="glossary.html#bijoe">BIJoe</a> indicates a read-only analytic database philosophy: keep heavy analytic queries off the live transactional <a class="term" href="glossary.html#db">DB</a> and instead use a dedicated schema or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#db">DB</a> for reporting. This improves performance and safety. Usage may involve scheduled jobs to refresh the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#bi">BI</a> data (for example, nightly <a class="term" href="glossary.html#etl">ETL</a> from <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#bijoe">BIJoe</a>). On the front-end, usage could be through charts or tables presented to managers (like number of requests this week, average processing time, etc.), likely embedded in the agent portal or delivered via reports.</p>

    <h2 id="key-features--functions">Key Features &amp; Functions</h2>
    <p>BiJoe’s key functionality is to query data warehouses easily. It provides abstractions so that a developer or advanced user can define a star schema and then run multi-dimensional queries without hand-writing complex <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> with joins and group by. For example, BiJoe might let you retrieve a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a> or Python object of results by specifying dimensions and measures in Python. It likely has functions to define cubes and dimensions. It might use an existing <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> library or its own querying mechanism. The description highlights producing dashboards, so one feature could be integration with a charting library or at least the ability to output query results that can feed a visualization. Another function is filtering – easily filtering on dimensions (e.g., only data from a certain date range or category) is important in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a>, and BiJoe would offer a way to apply filters without writing <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sql">SQL</a> syntax manually. Since it’s a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> app, BiJoe might also include models to configure some default analyses or to store queries. Possibly it offers a simple <a class="term" href="glossary.html#ui">UI</a> for selecting a dataset and breakdown (though this is speculative; it might rely on code or external tools instead). In essence, its initial essential function was likely to take a star schema in Postgres and allow queries like “give me count of facts grouped by this dimension and that dimension,” returning results quickly. It may also manage connections to the database and ensure that queries are optimized (perhaps using database views or materialized views for performance). If any part of Publik needed to embed a chart, BiJoe would provide the data side of that. Additionally, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a>-<a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> extension presumably works with BiJoe to define the star schema for <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> data (like each form submission becomes a fact with dimensions like form type, submission date, status, etc.), meaning BiJoe’s functionality includes being extensible via such plugins for different data sources.</p>

    <h2 id="unknowns-or-gaps">Unknowns or Gaps</h2>
    <p>Much of BiJoe’s inner workings are not detailed publicly. We don’t know the exact interface it provides – for instance, is there a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#dsl">DSL</a> (Domain Specific Language) to define <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> queries in Python? Or does it rely on writing <a class="term" href="glossary.html#yamljson">YAML/<a class="term" href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a></a> configs for cubes? Also unknown is how interactive it is – can non-technical users use BiJoe via a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#gui">GUI</a>, or is it mostly a developer’s tool that outputs data which is then manually turned into charts? The documentation simply notes it simplifies querying and producing dashboards, but not how. The integration with front-end charts is unclear: does BiJoe come with any pre-built dashboard components or does it expect integration with something like Grafana or custom code? Another gap is to what extent BiJoe handles incremental updates. If new data comes in (new form submissions), do the star schema tables update in real-time, or only on demand, or via scheduled tasks? Possibly <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a>-<a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> triggers updates, but specifics are not known. Additionally, BiJoe’s scalability is a question – <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> queries can be heavy; how does BiJoe cope with large data volumes (millions of records)? No info on performance tuning or limitations is readily available. For new developers, the lack of explicit examples in documentation might be a challenge – one would have to read BiJoe’s code or find sample usage to truly grasp how to formulate queries. Moreover, BiJoe is specialized for Postgres (it mentions Postgresql specifically[51]); it’s unknown if it could work with other databases (likely not needed, since Publik standardizes on Postgres). Finally, the origin of the name “<a class="term" href="glossary.html#bijoe">BIJoe</a>” is whimsical and the rationale isn’t documented – a trivial gap, but it highlights that some of these projects have minimal public marketing, focusing on internal use.</p>

    <h2 id="suppositions">Suppositions</h2>
    <p>We suppose that BiJoe’s future will involve becoming more user-friendly in terms of creating and viewing analytics. Perhaps a visual query builder or a set of predefined dashboard templates will be introduced so that city staff can get insights without writing any code or even needing a developer. It’s likely that BiJoe, in conjunction with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a>-<a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a>, will be expanded to cover data from other modules as well – for example, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> data (appointments) could be turned into an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> cube (e.g., facts of appointments with dimensions like service type, fulfilled or not, etc.), or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s payments could form a cube (payments fact with amount, date, status, payer category). If not already, we suspect those could come via analogous “*-<a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a>” extensions for each domain. Another guess: BiJoe might integrate with external <a class="term" href="glossary.html#bi">BI</a> tools or standards – for instance, exposing a standard <a class="term" href="glossary.html#olap">OLAP</a> interface (like <a class="term" href="glossary.html#xmla">XMLA</a> or an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#mdx">MDX</a> query endpoint) so that third-party <a class="term" href="glossary.html#bi">BI</a> software could connect. However, given its framing as a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> app, it may remain a more self-contained solution. We also think that as more data is collected in Publik, the importance of BiJoe will grow; thus the maintainers might invest in optimizing query performance (maybe using materialized views or summary tables to speed up common queries). On the development side, a new coder might suppose that to add a new metric, they would define a new model or view in the star schema and then use BiJoe’s library to query it – future improvements might simplify this to configuration rather than coding. As for naming, “<a class="term" href="glossary.html#bijoe">BIJoe</a>” suggests possibly an acronym (Business Intelligence) combined with a play on <a class="term" href="glossary.html#gi">GI</a> Joe (the action figure) – it’s not a technical supposition, but indicates the team’s informal naming style. In conclusion, BiJoe is expected to continue as the analytical pillar of Publik, potentially incorporating more automation (regular reports, trend analysis) and broadening its data coverage, so that stakeholders can readily evaluate the performance and usage of their digital services within Publik.</p>
