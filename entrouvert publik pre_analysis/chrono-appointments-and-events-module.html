    <h1>Chrono (Appointments &amp; Events Module)</h1>

    <h2 id="summary--integration">Summary &amp; Integration</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> is Publik’s appointment scheduling module, used for managing rendez-vous and event bookings[44]. It provides the functionality for citizens to book time slots for services (e.g. appointments at city hall, meetings with an official, reserving a place in an event) and for agents to administrate these schedules. In the context of Publik, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> works closely with other components: for instance, an online procedure in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> may require the user to choose an appointment slot (<a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> supplies the available slots), or the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> portal might offer a “Book an appointment” service powered by <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> essentially acts as the central calendar/agenda system for Publik, ensuring that bookings are coordinated and avoid double-booking. It can integrate with external calendar systems if needed (though primarily it maintains its own data). <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s data (agendas, slots, bookings) can also feed into BiJoe for statistics (like number of appointments, usage patterns), and <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> may use <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> if it needs to fetch information (for instance, confirming an appointment in an external agenda if one exists). However, primarily <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> is an internal service that other Publik modules call. One integration example: a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> form for scheduling a meeting might call <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> to create a booking when the form is submitted, or conversely, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> might trigger a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> workflow when an appointment is made. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> ensures that the citizen receives a confirmation (likely via email, possibly through <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> or directly).</p>

    <h2 id="philosophy--design--usage">Philosophy, Design &amp; Usage</h2>
    <p>The philosophy of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> is to provide a structured scheduling system that fits into e-government workflows. Many public services require managing queues and appointments (for passports, permits, etc.), so <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> is designed to handle these scenarios out-of-the-box. It likely uses a model of calendars (agendas), time slots, and bookings (reservations). The design is that an administrator can define one or more agendas (for example, one agenda per service or per location), set up opening hours or available time slots, and then the public can book those slots. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s name suggests a focus on time; accordingly, its design probably deals with time zones, recurring availability, and possibly capacity management (like how many people per slot). <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> is implemented as a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> app (consistent style), and the documentation hints at an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> and even data model diagrams for agendas[45]. It likely uses <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> models for events and reservations, and may also incorporate the django-tenant-schemas via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#hobo">Hobo</a> for multi-tenancy, so each tenant’s appointments are isolated. In terms of usage, staff users can use <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s back-office interface (possibly integrated in the agent portal) to create schedules, manually add or modify bookings, or block out times. Citizens use the front-office (via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a>) to see available appointment slots and book them – <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> provides that data and enforces rules (like preventing double booking the same slot). The design choices include providing a management command for tasks like anonymization of old bookings (to comply with data protection)[46], indicating an awareness of privacy in the design. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> is also built to handle events beyond one-on-one appointments – possibly small events or multi-person slots, given it mentions “évènements” (events) along with appointments[44]. This could mean it can manage sign-ups for limited-capacity events in addition to standard appointments. All these suggest <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s usage scenario is broad: any scheduling need within Publik should be served by <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> rather than using an external calendar.</p>

    <h2 id="key-features--functions">Key Features &amp; Functions</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s key features include agenda management, slot definition, booking workflow, and possibly notifications. Administrators can define one or multiple agendas (calendars) – each might correspond to a specific service desk or agent or type of appointment. For each agenda, they can define available time slots (e.g., Monday 9–12 every 15 minutes). <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> likely has a recurring schedule feature to avoid manually inputting every slot. Citizens can then see these slots and reserve one. The booking function ensures that when a slot is taken, it’s marked as booked and no one else can take it. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> probably collects user details during booking (either linked from their account or via form fields) and may issue confirmation emails automatically. Another function is booking modification/cancellation – users might be able to cancel or reschedule via a link or by contacting an agent, which <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> would handle by freeing up slots. On the back-end, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> provides a view for agents to see the schedule (maybe a calendar view) and the list of bookings, with options to add walk-in appointments or block times for meetings. It also has an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> that other modules can call; indeed, there is mention of an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> documentation in the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> wiki[47], suggesting one can programmatically create or query bookings. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> likely supports exporting calendars as <a class="term" href="glossary.html#ical">iCal</a>/<a class="term" href="glossary.html#ics">ICS</a> – possibly an agent could export an agenda to integrate with their personal calendar software (the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> code had references to .ics generation for events[48], which might relate to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s data). Additionally, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> includes maintenance commands; for example, an anonymize_bookings command is present to wipe personal data from past appointments[46], which is an important function for <a class="term" href="glossary.html#gdpr">GDPR</a> compliance. This shows <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s awareness of data lifecycle. In summary, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s initial essential functions are to allow creation of schedules, booking of time slots by users, management of those bookings by staff, and to ensure no conflicts in scheduling – with supplementary features like notifications and data management to round it out.</p>

    <h2 id="unknowns-or-gaps">Unknowns or Gaps</h2>
    <p>Certain aspects of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> remain unclear from the available info. For instance, how does <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> handle overbooking or walk-ins? It’s not specified if multiple bookings per slot are allowed (presumably not unless configured as a multi-capacity event) or if <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> can manage wait-lists (the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> wiki alludes to “gestion des files d’attente” – waiting queue management – as a topic of reflection[49], implying that feature might be undeveloped or experimental). Also unknown is whether <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> has any integration with external calendar systems (like syncing with an Outlook/Exchange or Google Calendar, which some public offices might use). There’s no explicit mention, so it might be standalone. Another gap is the notifications mechanism – <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> presumably needs to send confirmation or reminder emails; whether it relies on Publik’s general email configuration or has its own scheduling for reminders is not detailed publicly. The extent of the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> is also not fully known: we see references to management commands and an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> doc, but not the specifics of endpoints or features (like can you search for bookings by name, etc.). Additionally, how <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> interacts with identity management is a bit unclear – does it require a user account to book an appointment? Likely yes for traceability, but maybe it also allows anonymous bookings with contact info. Such details are not visible in the brief descriptions. Finally, performance under heavy use (e.g., a very popular booking that opens hundreds of slots and many users try to grab them at once) is not described – whether <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> implements any queue or atomic locking beyond database transactions (to avoid race conditions) is unknown. These are the kind of details that might only be found by examining code or detailed admin guides.</p>

    <h2 id="suppositions">Suppositions</h2>
    <p>We suppose that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> will be enhanced particularly in the area of queue management and capacity handling. The presence of discussions about waiting queues[49] suggests future versions might allow citizens to join a waitlist if no slots are available, or manage a queue of people for first-come first-served scenarios (for example, virtual queue numbers). Another likely development is improved notifications – possibly <a class="term" href="glossary.html#sms">SMS</a> reminders or integrations with calendar invites (sending an .ics file in confirmation emails). Given <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s nature, we can guess that it might integrate with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> or payments if any appointments require a fee (though not a common scenario, but imagine booking a facility that requires payment – <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> could generate a payment link via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>). We also anticipate <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> becoming more RESTful and comprehensive, to allow cities to embed calendars in their own interfaces if needed. A supposition on design: <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> probably uses <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a>’s scheduling capabilities or custom logic to handle recurring availability; if not, that could be an area of future improvement (making it easier to set complex schedules, holidays, etc.). We also guess that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> may eventually incorporate resource management – e.g., ensuring that if a given agent or room is booked, it’s reflected across multiple agendas (prevent double-booking the same person in two places). For multi-tenant setups, each tenant likely has separate agendas, and <a class="term" href="glossary.html#hobo">Hobo</a> ensures queries go to the right schema – this we assume is handled behind the scenes. Lastly, given <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s data (appointments) are sensitive, we suppose features like data retention policies (auto-delete personal data after X time) will continue to be important, as evidenced by the anonymization command. In summary, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> is expected to mature into a more full-featured scheduling system, possibly incorporating user feedback like managing no-shows or integrating with check-in systems, all while remaining an integral part of the Publik suite rather than a standalone calendar.</p>
