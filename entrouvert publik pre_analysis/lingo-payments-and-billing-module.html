    <h1>Lingo (Payments &amp; Billing Module)</h1>

    <h2 id="summary--integration">Summary &amp; Integration</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> is Publik’s payment and billing module, which manages transactions such as online payments and invoice tracking[53]. Initially developed with the needs of Publik Famille in mind (a specialized setup for family services like school meals billing), <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> provides the capability to handle financial workflows – from issuing bills to processing payments and marking them in the system. In the ecosystem, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> integrates closely with both external payment gateways and internal Publik processes. It uses Entr’ouvert’s <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> library to connect to major online payment providers (for example, credit card payment services)[54]. When a citizen goes to pay a fee (say, a daycare invoice or a form fee), <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> orchestrates the payment: it interacts with the payment service and then communicates back to Publik whether the payment succeeded or failed. This communication with Publik’s core is done via triggers – for instance, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> will call a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> workflow trigger to advance a request’s status from “Pending Payment” to “Paid” once a transaction is confirmed[55][54]. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> also likely integrates with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> to fetch or send data to city finance systems. For example, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> can retrieve a list of outstanding invoices for a user from an external financial application (via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a>) and display them on the user portal, then after payment, inform that system that the invoice was paid[56]. Thus, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> acts as the financial connector and processor within Publik.</p>

    <h2 id="philosophy--design--usage">Philosophy, Design &amp; Usage</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s philosophy is to make online payments and billing a seamless part of e-services, without requiring separate portals or manual reconciliation. It is designed to be modular and extensible, leveraging existing payment infrastructure through <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> (which supports various bank APIs)[57]. In terms of design, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> is built with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> and likely uses models to represent invoices, payments, and perhaps accounts. However, it often does not own all data: a key design choice is that it can work as an intermediary. For example, actual invoice records might reside in a city’s finance system; <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> doesn’t replicate all details but ensures the user can see the amount and reference and pay it. The usage pattern is typically: an authenticated user accesses a “My payments” section (provided by <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> data), sees a list of fees due, selects one to pay, and is redirected to a payment interface (handled by <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> integration). After completing payment, they return and see the status updated. On the admin side, clerks can use <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s interface to see transactions, confirm payments, or initiate refunds if needed. The design choices include heavy reliance on webhooks and triggers – rather than tightly coupling with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> flows, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> operates somewhat asynchronously. For example, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> might mark a request as awaiting payment; <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> monitors or is invoked to process payment; then <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> triggers <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> when done[55]. This decoupling is philosophically aligned with microservice ideas: each module handles its domain (financial vs form processing) and communicates via defined interfaces. Usage also involves configuration: an administrator must configure payment providers (<a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> keys, endpoints) in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> (or underlying <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> settings) and possibly map external invoice data fields to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s expectations (for those using external billing systems). <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> also is used to calculate pricing in some cases – “gestion de tarification” suggests it can apply pricing rules or tariffs. In Publik Famille, tariff calculation (like how much a family pays for daycare based on income) could be done by <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> or at least stored by it. That implies the design includes a way to define pricing schemes, which the system can then use to generate invoice amounts.</p>

    <h2 id="key-features--functions">Key Features &amp; Functions</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s essential features include invoice listing, payment processing, and receipt/confirmation handling. It can present to a user the list of bills that need payment, including details like amount, due date, and description (these might be fetched from an external system via connectors)[56]. For payment processing, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> interfaces with multiple payment gateways (credit card, possibly e-wallets, etc.) by using the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> abstraction[57]. This means <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> can initiate a transaction with, say, Paybox or PayFIP (common French payment services) through a unified <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a>, and handle the response. A crucial function is to maintain the state of a transaction: pending, successful, failed, canceled. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> then fires the appropriate trigger in Publik to inform other modules of the outcome[55] (for instance, triggering <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> to mark a form submission as paid, or triggering <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> to mark an invoice as settled in an external app). <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> likely also logs transactions and stores references like transaction IDs, timestamps, and maybe receipts. It may generate or store a proof of payment (like a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#pdf">PDF</a> receipt or a reference number) that can be shown to the user. Another function is billing management: though much of the billing data might come from elsewhere, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> could maintain some records for internal use – e.g., if an invoice is split into multiple payments or if partial payments are allowed (though typically not likely, so maybe not). Tarification management could allow calculating an invoice based on certain criteria (this part is a bit unclear – it might be implemented if <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> also handles creating invoice records, not just processing them). Since <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> is in production use, features like handling payment notifications (IPNs from payment gateways) are definitely implemented: it must handle asynchronous notifications from payment systems to confirm a payment, especially if the user does not return to the site. Security features like verifying payment signatures and ensuring data integrity are also a part of its functionality (inherited from <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> largely). Essentially, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s initial set of functions revolve around providing a payment pipeline – from showing what needs to be paid, through processing the payment, to updating records once paid, all integrated into Publik’s user experience.</p>

    <h2 id="unknowns-or-gaps">Unknowns or Gaps</h2>
    <p>Some specifics of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> are not publicly described. For example, how exactly does one configure the external “metier” applications’ data exchange? The docs mention that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> can inform a third-party software that a payment occurred[56], but the mechanism (likely via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> connectors or direct <a class="term" href="glossary.html#db">DB</a> access) isn’t detailed. It’s also not explicitly stated whether <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> keeps a local copy of invoices or if it operates entirely on live external data. Possibly it has a model for “Invoice” with at least an identifier, user, amount, status, etc., even if the source is external. The extent of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s billing capabilities beyond payments is also unclear – can <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> create an invoice or is it always given one to process? The term “gestion de tarification” hints <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> might, for example, apply a price list to a certain request type (like a fee for a form submission). If so, details on how those rules are defined are not found in the quick references. Also unknown is whether <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> handles complex scenarios like partial payments, installments, or refunds natively. Since initial focus was Publik Famille (likely straightforward cases like monthly bills for school cafeteria), it might not handle more advanced billing without custom development. Another gap is how it integrates on the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#ui">UI</a>: do users see their invoices in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> via special <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>-provided cells or pages? The implementation of that integration isn’t documented externally, though presumably it exists (maybe a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> plugin or a direct template usage). In terms of technical detail, it’s not public how <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> stores payment credentials or interacts with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> – likely using config files or database tables for merchant IDs and secrets; but the security of that (encryption, etc.) isn’t described in user docs. Lastly, error handling and support – e.g., if a payment fails or times out, how <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> handles that in the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#ux">UX</a> – is not described outside of possibly the code or internal docs.</p>

    <h2 id="suppositions">Suppositions</h2>
    <p>We suppose that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> will be expanded to cover broader use cases as more municipalities adopt online payments. This could mean adding more connector support for additional payment providers or newer payment methods (e.g., mobile payments, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#qr">QR</a> codes) by extending <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> itself. Also, since it’s tightly tied to Publik Famille currently, one might guess it will become more generalized for any kind of payment scenario within Publik. For instance, if a city wants to charge for a parking permit application via a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> form, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> could handle that just as well as a canteen invoice – we assume <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> either already supports that or will with minor tweaks. Another likely development is the improvement of user-facing features like a unified billing history: users could log in and see all their past payments and receipts through <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>. If not already present, it’s a logical addition. We also anticipate continued reliance on external systems for core accounting – <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> probably won’t become a full ledger or accounting software; instead it will stay as the facilitator of payments and rely on existing systems for accounting details. In coding terms, future commits might address new versions of payment APIs or security updates (<a class="term" href="glossary.html#psp">PSP</a> protocols, etc.), as well as integration with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#passerelle">Passerelle</a> for retrieving invoice lists (for example, adding connectors for new financial software). We suppose that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a>’s tarification aspect might evolve to handle more dynamic pricing; for now, it’s likely configured per use-case, but maybe a generic rate-calculation engine could appear if needed by multiple clients. For new developers, a sensible assumption is that working with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> involves understanding <a class="term" href="glossary.html#eopayment">EOPayment</a> and possibly writing connectors to financial systems; this will probably remain true, so improving documentation and abstraction around that might be on the roadmap. Another supposition: given the importance of payments, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> could incorporate features like retrying failed transactions, tracking payment attempts, and ensuring compliance with banking regulations (<a class="term" href="glossary.html#pci">PCI</a> compliance, etc.) by delegating to the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#psp">PSP</a>. These aspects might not be visible but are critical behind the scenes. In summary, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#lingo">Lingo</a> is poised to remain a crucial but somewhat specialized module, growing primarily in terms of integration breadth (more payment options, more systems to sync with) and user convenience (making it easier for both users and admins to handle payments in Publik).</p>
