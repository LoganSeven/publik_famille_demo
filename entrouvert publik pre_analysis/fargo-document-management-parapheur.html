    <h1>Fargo (Document Management “Parapheur”)</h1>

    <h2 id="summary--integration">Summary &amp; Integration</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> is Publik’s document management module, described as the “porte-documents” (document briefcase) of the ecosystem[40]. In practical terms, it serves as an electronic document cabinet and possibly an electronic signature workflow (the term parapheur in French administration refers to a system for circulating and signing official documents). <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>’s role in the ecosystem is to handle uploaded or generated documents that are part of user requests or internal processes. For example, when a citizen submits supporting documents through a form (attachments) or when an agent produces a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#pdf">PDF</a> report or decision letter, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> would store these files and manage their lifecycle. It likely integrates with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> (forms can send their file attachments to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> for storage), and possibly with the portal (<a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a>) to allow users or agents to download documents from their case files. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> might also interface with external archiving or signing tools, but within Publik it is the central repository for unstructured data (files) related to workflows. It ensures that documents are available to the right users: an agent can retrieve a document from <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> via the back-office, or a user might get a copy of an official document via the portal, with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> delivering it. Integration points also include potential triggers in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> workflows: e.g., at a certain step a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#pdf">PDF</a> is generated and stored in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>, or a request is marked as needing a signature, which <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> facilitates.</p>

    <h2 id="philosophy--design--usage">Philosophy, Design &amp; Usage</h2>
    <p>The philosophy behind <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> is to provide a unified document repository that plugs into digital workflows. Instead of scattering files on disk or embedding them in form data, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> offers a structured way to manage documents, likely including metadata, access control, and possibly versioning or validation. It’s designed to meet the needs of government processes where official documents must be handled securely and often signed or approved. The choice to separate <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> as a module suggests a separation of concerns: <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> handles form logic, while <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> handles document storage and processing. <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> is presumably built with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#django">Django</a> as well (consistent with the others), managing models for documents, folders, and perhaps signature status. Its usage involves both citizens and agents: a citizen might upload files through a form (those go into <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> under the hood), and an agent might add or modify documents during case processing. There might be a user interface (maybe via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> or the agent portal) that allows browsing a “dossier” of documents for a request. The design likely includes features such as permission control, ensuring only authorized personnel can see certain documents (for instance, an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#hr">HR</a> document vs a public document). Because it is referred to as a parapheur, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> possibly supports workflows like routing a document to multiple signatories or stamping a document when approved. However, given limited info, it seems the core design is a document store with some workflow hooks. In usage, an administrator would set up <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> as part of the system so that every submission or generated output gets stored in a central location (often /var/lib/fargo on the server, based on typical deployment conventions). The idea is that all files are handled by <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> service, simplifying backup and security (versus being spread out). Users interacting with <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> do so indirectly: e.g., when they click “Download attachment” in the portal or when an agent clicks “Sign document”, behind the scenes <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> is serving or updating that file.</p>

    <h2 id="key-features--functions">Key Features &amp; Functions</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>’s essential features likely include: document storage and retrieval, document organization, and possibly signature workflow support. As a storage engine, it handles saving files (perhaps in a database or filesystem with references). It might generate unique IDs or filenames, and ensure files are not lost or duplicated. As a “briefcase”, it might group related documents – for instance, all documents for a given <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> submission or for a certain case can be treated as a set. This could manifest as a folder or dossier concept in <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>. Another key function is providing a link between documents and Publik entities: <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> would have an <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> or signals such that when <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> workflow reaches a “signing” step, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> knows which document to present for signature to which agent. There is also likely a function for anonymization or archival: over time, documents might need to be archived or purged for privacy (some support might exist, akin to <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a>’s anonymize bookings for personal data – <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> might have to anonymize or delete files after retention period, though this is speculative). Additionally, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> probably exposes download endpoints (ensuring authentication) so that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#combo">Combo</a> can offer direct links for users to get their files. Considering the e-signature aspect, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> might integrate with a signing tool or allow an agent to apply a signature stamp. At minimum, it would allow uploading a signed version of a file or storing a signature certificate. The initial release of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> (version 1.x[41] suggests it’s relatively new and basic) may focus on storage; essential functions would include creating document records, linking them to form submissions or other contexts, and providing <a class="term" href="glossary.html#crud">CRUD</a> (create, read, update, delete) operations via an admin or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a>. The “porte-documents” metaphor implies it holds documents in a way accessible to users – for example, a citizen might have a personal space listing the documents they’ve submitted (or permits they’ve received), implemented via <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> linking with their account. In summary, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>’s primary function is to ensure that all files in Publik workflows are properly managed and accessible when needed, acting as the digital filing cabinet for the platform.</p>

    <h2 id="unknowns-or-gaps">Unknowns or Gaps</h2>
    <p><a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> is relatively less documented externally, so several aspects are unknown. For one, the full scope of “parapheur” functionality is unclear – does <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> simply store documents, or does it also manage signing flows (like sending documents to officials for e-signature and tracking that)? The one-line description[42] doesn’t elaborate. If electronic signature is part of <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>’s purpose, the details of how it’s implemented (what cryptographic tools or standards are used) are not public. Another unknown is the data model: the <a class="term" href="glossary.html#chrono">Chrono</a> wiki references a generated model graph for agendas, but we have none for <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> – we don’t know if <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> uses a hierarchical folder model or just tags documents by case <a class="term" href="glossary.html#id">ID</a>, etc. Also, it’s not documented how <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> interacts with external systems – for instance, some cities use dedicated archival systems or external parapheurs; whether <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> can export or sync with those is not stated. Performance and storage strategy (files on disk vs in database as BLOBs) is also not clear from available info. Additionally, how <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> ensures security (encryption at rest? virus scanning of uploads?) is not described in the docs we saw – likely such considerations exist internally, but they’re not mentioned. For new developers, finding <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> or usage documentation for <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> might be a challenge; it appears to rely on internal knowledge or code reading to fully grasp capabilities. Finally, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>’s interaction with multi-tenant setups is an open question: presumably each tenant’s documents are siloed, but the mechanism (separate file directories or tenant IDs) isn’t obvious without deeper docs.</p>

    <h2 id="suppositions">Suppositions</h2>
    <p>Based on its intended purpose, we suppose that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> will evolve to include more robust parapheur features such as digital signing and document workflow. Possibly, upcoming commits might introduce integration with France’s national electronic signature mechanisms or adherence to archiving standards (since public sector document management often requires compliance to norms like <a class="term" href="glossary.html#pdf">PDF</a>/A, timestamps, etc.). Another guess is that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> might eventually offer a user-facing document portal – for example, allowing users to see all their official documents (permits, certificates) in one place. This could tie into Publik’s goal of a unified user account experience. We also suppose that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> uses file storage on the server’s filesystem (with paths per tenant) and keeps metadata in the database – a standard approach, though not confirmed. Given that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> is at version 1.x, it is likely under active development; we anticipate new features such as bulk download, integration with scanning or <a class="term" href="glossary.html#ocr">OCR</a> for incoming paper documents, or more administrative tools for document retention policies. For developers, an educated guess is that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a>’s <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> is similar to other modules – possibly a <a class="term" href="glossary.html#rest">REST</a> <a class="term" href="glossary.html#api">API</a> to list and fetch documents, and maybe signals for <a class="term" href="glossary.html#wcs">WCS</a> to push files to it. If <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> does not yet handle electronic signature internally, one might have to integrate it with a third-party signing service; however, since Entr’ouvert also has a project called Cryptic (for digital certificates)[43], it’s plausible that <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> will leverage such components to offer in-house signing in the future. In conclusion, <a class="term" href="glossary.html#fargo">Fargo</a> is expected to grow from a basic document repository into a more feature-rich document workflow system, aligning with the increasing digitalization of administrative paperwork.</p>
