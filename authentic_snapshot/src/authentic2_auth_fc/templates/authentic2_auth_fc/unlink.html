      Deleting this link won't delete your user account. However, once the link with
      FranceConnect is deleted, it is no more possible to use FranceConnect to automatically log
      in to your user account. It is still possible to link your user account again, using the
      “FranceConnect” button on your account page.

        On your next authentications, you will have to type in a password. Clicking the “Unlink”
        button here will prompt you to pick this new password. Please, mind that this password will
        be your local account's, not the one to the account used through FranceConnect whatsoever.
        It will be used when logging in to this website with your email address rather than through
        FranceConnect.
