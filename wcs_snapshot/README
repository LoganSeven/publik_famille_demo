Then you need to run the tests

  PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) py.test tests/

PostgreSQL tests.

Use of Generative AI
--------------------

This project does not allow contributions generated by large languages
models (LLMs) and chatbots. This ban includes tools like ChatGPT,
Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, and Devin AI. We are taking this step as
precaution due to the potential negative influence of AI generated
content on quality, as well as a general stance against those systems
raising numerous ecological and ethical issues.

This ban of AI generated content applies to all parts of the project,
including, but not limited to, code, documentation, issues, and artworks.

  Upstream doesn't specify which version of OFL instead simply links to
  OFL page. Hence latest version of OFL is considered.
